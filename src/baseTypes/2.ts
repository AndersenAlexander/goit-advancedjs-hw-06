// A JavaScript variable can store a value of any type:

let anything = -20;
anything = "Text";
anything = {};

export {};

// What type should you assign to a variable named anything in TypeScript to maintain its flexibility?
// 1.2
// The most flexible type in TypeScript is `any`.
let anything: any = -20;
anything = "Text";
anything = {};
